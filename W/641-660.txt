I should have known better than to underestimate the omniscient power of the internet. It was a travesty. I had been so sure I could augur the future, but it seems I was quite wrong. pandemonium ensued. I was completely circumvented. I should have known better than to mess with something so mercurial. In the end, it was all quite innocuous. I ceded defeat and capitulated.
