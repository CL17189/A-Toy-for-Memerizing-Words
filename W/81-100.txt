 within minutes, the kitchen was a whirlwind of activity. Jack and Jill worked with a feverish intensity, packing food and supplies into every nook and cranny they could find. They knew they had to be prepared for the worst.

As the minutes ticked by, the storm grew closer and closer. The wind picked up, and the rain began to pour down. But Jack and Jill didn't stop working. They knew their lives depended on it.

Finally, when they were sure they had done everything they could, they huddled together in the center of the house, waiting for the storm to hit.

And hit it did. The wind howled and the rain pounded against the windows. The house shook and the foundations creaked. But Jack and Jill held on to each other, and they rode out the storm together.

When it was over, they emerged from the house to survey the damage. The storm had been fierce, but they had made it through.

Looking at the destruction all around them, Jack and Jill knew they had been lucky. They had survived the storm, but they knew it would be a long time before they forgot the ordeal.
