His whole life felt like one big cornucopia of enervation. He wanted to congeal and proscribe all of it. But he knew he couldn't. There were just too many people, too many things happening. It was all a big charade and he was just a nexus, a parch in the system. He tried to tantalize himself with thoughts of narcissism and power, but it all felt hollow. In the end, he absconded with the cherubic roster of names and ran away to disperate parts unknown.
