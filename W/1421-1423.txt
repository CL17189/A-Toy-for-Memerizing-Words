I was convinced that if I could just find the right combination, I would be able to command the wind and the rain. Unfortunately, my powers never manifested, and I had to content myself with being a regular old human. 

But then, one day, I found a new use for my runes. I discovered that I could use them to predict the future. And not just my future, but the future of the whole world! I started making predictions about wars and natural disasters, and I was always right. 

People started to take notice of my talent, and soon I was in high demand. I was consulted by world leaders and famous celebrities. I was even asked to appear on television. I was living the high life, and it was all thanks to my runes. 

But then, one day, I made a prediction that didn't come true. I said that a certain country was going to be invaded, and it didn't happen. I was laughed at and ridiculed. I was a laughing-stock, and my career was over.

But I still have my runes, and I still believe in their power. I may not be able to change the world anymore, but I can still use them to predict the future. And who knows? Maybe one day my predictions will come true again.
