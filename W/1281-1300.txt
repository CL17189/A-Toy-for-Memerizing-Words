We must cononize their efforts and bring about true euphoria. Only then will we be able to amity the situation and come out ahead. They are being sparing with their resources, but we must provisory hold out for a better future. This is not the time to be immemorial, we must be feisty and wiretap their plans. We must be zesty in our defense of liberty. We must show them eclat that we will not be maladroit in the face of their oppression. We must attune ourselves to the fight and smother their attempts to control us.
