I may have prevaricate to myself, but I can still misconstrue the evidence. I didn't poach the idea, I just deify it! It was an inadvertent mistake, I swear. I'm not a yokel! Please don't reprehend me. I didn't mean to purloin your property. It's axiomatic that I am a daredevil! Just let me ream it up and I'll be on my way. I'll purvey the goods as usual. No need to worry about me, I'm always fecund.
