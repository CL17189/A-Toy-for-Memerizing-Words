Emaciate your frame and try something svelte for a change. You might just find that you like it. And stop being such a jingoist! Rookies are always trying to cadge a freebie from the veterans. Just because you're new doesn't mean you can't incubate a little something of your own. Teeter on the brink of greatness. It's the minutia that will make you tangy. Hodgepodge is for the weak. Cavort with the best of them. Moratorium on the negative self-talk. Obfuscate your way to the top.
