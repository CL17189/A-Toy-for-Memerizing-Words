The brash colours and glowering paintings were a wastrel's work, perforating her vision and causing her to vacillate between feelings of malaise and coagulated anger. She knew she should procrastinate no longer and set about metamorphosing the room into a space that exuded calm and serenity. But the process was not without its challenges; every day she was beset by a spate of new problems, from effluviums of dust to hordes of jejune gadflies. But eventually, after much grandstanding and feckless wandering, she reached nirvana.
