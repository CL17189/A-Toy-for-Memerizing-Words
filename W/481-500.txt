The overuse of "earshot", "melodramatic", and "indigent" has made for a lugubrious and demure literary landscape. The redolent, serpentine, and phlegmatic prose of our forebears has given way to a laconic, insular, and illusory style of writing. The once-great literary traditions of our hackneyed and forthright forefathers have been replaced by a stingy, tepid, and prating fad. The fetid and demagogic domicile of our literature has become a breeding ground for pedantry and dissent.
