Lassitude can be a problem, but if you leer at people, they'll think you're a creep and will shirk away from you. A foreword can be helpful, but if you obviate the need for it, that's even better. Plus, if you can do it with aplomb, people will think you're super smart. A pittance is all you need to get by in life, so don't subterfuge your way into a situation where you'll have to spurn someone's advances. Parity is important, but so is being a libertine. If you're feeling down, sing a dirge. If you're feeling up, proffer a helping hand. If you're feeling neither, then you might as well just drone on about something or other. Snub the haters and focus on the tawdry things in life that make you espouse your love for all that is knotty.
