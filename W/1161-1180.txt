

I was recently diagnosed with clinical depression and my doctor prescribed me a course of treatment that included taking a placebo pill every day. I was a bit skeptical at first, but after a few days I noticed that my mood was improving and I was able to get out of bed and face the day.

Now, every morning, I take my placebo pill and Lambaste the day ahead of me. I expurgate all the negative thoughts from my mind and self-abasement my way to a better day. I acclimate to the idea that today is going to be a good day, no matter what. I bask in the sun, even on the cloudy days, and intransigent my way through whatever challenges come my way.

I lionize the power of positive thinking and am now a proponent of the placebo effect. Beige days are a thing of the past and I no longer conflate happiness with material things. Life is labile and full of serendipity. I am no longer stymied by my mental health, but discombobulate the negative thinking that once held me back.

If you're feeling down, I highly recommend giving the placebo effect a try. It's foolproof and will concatenate into a better life. Just don't tell anyone I told you. That would be a gaffe.
