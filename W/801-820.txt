Maybe it was because I was a little bit weird, or maybe it was because I was always the one who was willing to try something new. Regardless, I always felt like I was on the outside looking in.

As I've gotten older, I've come to realize that being on the outside isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I often enjoy being the one who isn't quite like everyone else. It gives me a chance to view the world in a different way, and it allows me to see things that others might miss.

So, if you're feeling like an outsider, don't despair. Embrace it! You might just find that being different is what makes you special.
