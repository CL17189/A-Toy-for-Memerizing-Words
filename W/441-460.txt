He got out of bed and went to the kitchen, only to find that the fridge was empty. George was sure he had stocked it the night before, but there was not a single thing in it. He checked the pantry and found that it was completely empty as well. His suspicions were confirmed: something was definitely wrong.

George decided to go outside and see if his neighbors were having the same problem. When he got to the first house, he saw that the fridge was empty and the pantry was bare. He knocked on the door and asked the woman who answered if she knew what was going on. She said she had no idea, but that she was going to the store to see if they had any food.

 George went to the next house, but the same thing was happening there. All the food was gone. He was starting to get worried. He didn't know what was going on, but it seemed like everyone was affected. He went to the store, only to find that it was closed. He was starting to feel panicky.

Luckily, George ran into his neighbor Jim. Jim told him that there was a big sale at the grocery store and that everyone had gone there to stock up. George felt relieved and went to the store to get some food.

Although George was relieved that there was a simple explanation for the empty fridge, he was still a little annoyed. He had been looking forward to a quiet weekend, but it seemed like that was not going to happen.
