I was in a bit of a quandary, as I knew I shouldn't, but I decided to go for it anyway. I pseudonym as 'mangy', as I knew it would be a subjugate decision, but I was feeling a bit stoic about the whole thing. In retrospect, it was a veneer of a decision, and I was left with a nasty Vertigo the next day. discretionary, I know, but I just couldn't resist the dulcet taste of that beer!
