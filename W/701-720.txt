The salubrious effects of the product were contentious and many people thought it was a misdemeanor to even try it. The pusillanimous CEO then delineated the parsimonious reasons for why the product was created and why it would be ill. bred to not try it. The diaphanous arguments and the agape look on the CEO's face convinced the callow board members, who then waylaid any further discussion and voted to eschew the product. The sluggard CEO was pleased with the outcome and quickly disavowed any responsibility for the product's success or failure.
