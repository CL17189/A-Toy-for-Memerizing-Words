For him, bliss is a state of mind and he finds the concept of "vile" to be absolutely hilarious. He is also quite hideous and his sense of humor is legendary. When people meet him, they often say that he looks like he's up to something. And they're not wrong. He's always up to something. Whether it's scheming, plotting, or just making a joke, he's always got something going on.
