I would spend hours reading dictionaries and thesauruses, memorizing lists of words and their definitions. I was convinced that if I knew enough words, I could express anything I wanted to and be understood by anyone.

But then I grew up and realized that words are only part of the equation. The way you use them matters just as much, if not more. And sometimes, no matter how many words you know, you just can¡¯t find the right ones.

Take, for example, the word ¡°barbarous.¡± It has a very specific meaning, and yet I see it used all the time to describe things that are merely unpleasant or inconvenient. The other day, I heard someone describe a parking garage as ¡°barbarous¡± because it was dirty and poorly lit.

Now, I¡¯m not saying that parking garages can¡¯t be dirty and poorly lit. But if that¡¯s the only thing wrong with them, then they¡¯re not really barbarous, are they?

The same goes for the word ¡°calamity.¡± I see it tossed around a lot to describe things like losing your keys or spilling your coffee. But a calamity is a lot more than just a minor annoyance. It¡¯s a major disaster.

If you want to use words correctly, you have to understand their meanings. And sometimes, that means looking them up in a dictionary.
